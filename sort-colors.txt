Program:
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Approach:
1. Traverse in the "nums" with i=0 so it will start from 0th element
2. The second pointer is set to i+1.It will start from the next element. 
3. Now compare and put the greater element in the temporary variable and the smaller one to greater one.
4. Keep swapping till you get elements sorted in 0s,1s and 2s.
