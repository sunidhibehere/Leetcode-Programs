Program:
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

Approach:
1. Take two string variables rev and temp.
2. Traverse the entire string using a loop.
3. Inside the loop, use another loop to find a word and store that in temp variable till a blank space in encountered.
4. We then add that string to the rev string.
5. Re-initialize the temp variable to null.
6. Return the reverse string after the execution of loop.
