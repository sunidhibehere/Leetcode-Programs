Program:
A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.
  For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].
  The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).
  For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
  Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
  While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.
Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.
The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

Approach:
1. The nextPermutation function takes a vector nums as input and is used to find the next lexicographically greater permutation of the elements in nums.
2. First calculate the size of the nums vector and initialize the index variable to -1.
3. Search for the first element index from the right (starting from the second-to-last element) such that nums[i] is less than nums[i+1]. This step helps identify the rightmost element that can be modified to create a greater permutation.
4. If an index is found (i.e., there's a possible next permutation), we find the smallest element greater than nums[index] from the right. This element is found by iterating from the right end of the vector. Once found, it swaps this element with nums[index].
5. Finally, it reverses the elements to the right of index. This step ensures that the remaining elements to the right are in ascending order, making the permutation as small as possible while still being greater than the original.
