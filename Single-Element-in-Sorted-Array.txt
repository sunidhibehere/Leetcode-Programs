Program:
You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.
Return the single element that appears only once.
Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

Approach:
1. Create a variable res and initialize it to zero.
2. Run a loop till the end of array.
3. Use the XOR operator which results in zero if it is performed with itself otherwise gives one.
4. This will cancel out all pairs and we will get the element which is single.
