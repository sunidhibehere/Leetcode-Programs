Approach:
1. We create a variable max_sum and initialize to the minimum value. It stores the maximum sum so far.
2. new_sum variable stores the sum of elements of subarray currently being traversed.
3. We start a loop and add the element value in the new_sum variable.
4. If new_sum is found to be greater than the max_sum then we store new_sum in max_sum.
5. If new_sum at any point is found to be less than zero,we do not perform addition rather store zero to new_sum,as sum of negative numbers will give negative value which is not needed.
6. After the loop is executed, we return the max_sum,which stores the maximum subarray sum.
