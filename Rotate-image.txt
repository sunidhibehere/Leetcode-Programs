Program:
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Approach:
1. Reverse the matrix first. Reverse means bring the bottom row to top and top row to bottom and then top+1 row to down-1 row and continue till down-n>top+n
2. After that transpose matrix.
3. For anticlockwise first transpose then reverse.
